why_threefold = "For me access to the internet and internet capacity to be part of the digital economy is for all people independent from race, colour, religion or geographic location one of the most important basic human rights we need on this planet. With ThreeFold we support big time this important right by building information technology that can be used to build what we call the Autonomous Internet. Everyone can contribute to build this Autonomous Internet by adding hardware to the grid of capacity which leads to a complete decentralised ownership. Decentralisation is one of the key ingredients of the inclusive approach as no single company or government can shut down this capacity grid."
